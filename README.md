Help collaborate for practice , I want to experience pulling and merging real life scenarios
You can add and do anything

Note:
GitHub has no server side technology supported, so Node. js applications won't run on GitHub pages
You need to test manually on your localhost

Understand how the following works:
node.js
node express
npm for dependencies
EJS
CLI commands (node)
Then you are ready!

Thank you!
